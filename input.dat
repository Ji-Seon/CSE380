# Pick a problem to be solved
problem = 1                     # 0 = Simple ODE
				# 1 = Charged Particle Motion in a Vertical Electric Field

# Pick a solution method; note that problem 1 is not compatible with solution 0 and that problem 0 is only compatible with solution 0 or running in verification mode in which it runs both solution 0 & 1.
solMethod = 3                   # 0 = Forward Euler

# Pick a step size to be had
stepSize = 0.0001               # Smaller steps result in more accurate solutions! - Recommended in steps of 10^(-x), e.g. 0.1, 0.01, 0.001, etc...

# Pick a number of steps to implement
max_iter =   100000	        # Integer values only please

# Pick if you want to run in Verification mode (Only viable for problem 0) - Compares numerical to analytical solution
verificationMode = 0            # 0 = Run in Verification mode
			        # 1 = Do not run in Verification mode

# Pick if you want to run in debug mode
debugMode = 0                   # 0 = Run in debug mode
				# 1 = Do not run in debug mode
